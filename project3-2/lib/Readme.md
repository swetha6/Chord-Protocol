# **Implementation of Chord protocol**


### **How to run?**

```elixir
mix run lib/project3.ex numNodes numRequests
```
### **What is working?**
* Each node has 5 states {id, finger_table, pred, succ, hash_value}
* Initially a random value is picked and request is sent to the node
* The finger table is constructed using the hash values generated by sha256 fucntiona and hops are made using the key values
* Given the number of requests, each number makes that many requests and they are done concurrently

### **Largest Network we could run**
numNodes = 10000
numRequests = 100

### **The output time is in the range of 1/2 O(Log(numNodes))**
